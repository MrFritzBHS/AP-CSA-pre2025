# Scope Example
  
Do the following:

1. Run the following code to confirm that you cannot access the variables outside of their scope levels in the `toString() ` method.
2. Explain to someone sitting next to you why you can’t access these.
3. Try to fix the errors by either using variables that are in scope or moving the **variable declarations** so that the variables have larger scope.

## Output
