# Main code - comments to guide you

COMMENTS ONLY - you build it

Copy and paste **EVERYTHING** below and replace the ENTIRE Main class in the Walkers and Positions Main class

```java 
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Opening prompt
        System.out.println("\n\n>>> Welcome to the game: ~Two Walkers~");
        System.out.println(">>> Both players begin at the same starting position");
        System.out.println(">>> and they each walk a random distance in one direction");
        System.out.println(">>> each turn.");
        System.out.println(">>> the closest to (0, 0) after 5 walks wins!");
        System.out.println("\n\n");

        // TODO
        // make a Position object using random x and y values between -10 and 10. You will have to use the Math.random() method


        // TODO
        // get the names of the two players


        // TODO
        // Instantiate the two Walker objects using the names of the players and the Postion object created eariler


        // TODO
        // Print a "starting summary" that describes the location of each player

        // TODO
        // create a loop that runs through the five turns

            // TODO 
            // Collect user input from each player to determine direction of travel

            // TODO
            // move the walker object in the chosen distance

            // TODO
            // Print out a summary of players' positions

        // TODO
        // Determine the winner using the closerToHome() method in the Walker class.
