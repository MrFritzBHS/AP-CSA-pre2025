# Instructions

After discussing / running the code with a partner, complete these challenges:


## Card Deck Challenges

### 1 - First ten cards
Make a loop to print out the first 10 cards of the `deck` array

### 2 - Only aces

Make a loop that traverses the entire array and only prints the card if it is an ace. Also print the index of the card in the `deck` array. 

Be sure to run this code a few times to ensure it produces different results.

### 3 - Only spades

Make a loop that traverses the entire array and only prints the card if it is a spade. Also print the index of the card in the `deck` array. 

Be sure to run this code a few times to ensure it produces different results.

### 4 - Limited deck

Create an array called `miniDeck` of 20 cards with only 10s, Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces. Then, create a loop to print each card in the array. (They do not have to be shuffled)

### 5 - Super Challenge: Find the card

After shuffling the deck of cards, ask the user input a specific card (Ex: `6 of Diamonds`). Find where that card is in the array, and print its location to the console.

Example:
```
Which card would you like to find? 6 of Diamonds
The 6 of Diamonds is at index *41* in the deck
```

## Array Challenges

After completing the card deck challenges, complete the challenges below inside of the `arrayChallenges` method:

1. make an array of 500 random ints from 1-5000
3. calculate and print the average of that array
5. find and print the min of the array as well as its index
7. find and print the max of the array as well as its index
11. Make a String array of 10 words (you will have to initialize the values). Using a loop to traverse the array, find and print the longest word in the array --> to find length of string --> str.length()
