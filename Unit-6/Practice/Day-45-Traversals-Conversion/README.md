# Instructions

In this programming exercise, you will convert for loops between **index-based** for loops and **for : each** for loops. 

In each static method, comment out the algorithm of the existing for loop, and rewrite the loop using the other method.

## `printOdds`

Comment out the index-based for loop, and rewrite it as a **for : each** loop.

## `findMax`

Comment out the for : each loop and rewrite as an **index-based for loop**

## `getAverage`

Write a loop (both styles) which will calculate the average of all the number in an array. Return the average.

## `printClassRoster`

Write a loop (both styles) that prints out each of the students in the `classroom` array in the form:

```
Julian Jones is in grade 9
Larisa Torres is in grade 10
Amada Robin is in grade 10
Mikka Leads is in grade 9
Jay Khalil is in grade 10
```

You may need to take a look at the [`Student`](https://github.com/MrFritzBHS/AP-CSA/edit/main/Unit-6/Practice/Day-45-Traversals-Conversion/Student.java) class file to help you with this one.
